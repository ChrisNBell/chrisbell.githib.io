          <h2>What is loafing?</h2>
          <p>
            When a cat is "loafing," they have all four paws tucked underneath
            their body, resembling a loaf of bread. Cats often loaf when they
            are resting, and it is also a method for them to keep warm.

          <h2>Why do cats love to loaf?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Comfort: The loaf position allows cats to stay warm and cozy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Security: When a cat feels like they are in a safe place, they
              will retract their vicious claws and tuck them under their body.
              So, not only are they safe, but so are you!
            </li>
            <li>
              Disguise: Sometimes cats will act as if they are in a relaxed
              loaf, drawing you in with their cuteness. However, this is used as
              an attack tactic, as they won't hesitate to pounce and devour your
              hand.
